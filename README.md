# The-Caterpillar-Game
- Developed a “copycat” version of the Snake Game in Java 
- This version of the game drew a caterpillar to eat the apple instead of a snake 
- Gained hands-on experience with front-end tools (Java GUI: Graphical User Interface and Swing), used front-end interfaces such as ActionListener 
- Utilized OOP (Object Oriented Programming), worked with file writing and processing
- Worked with data structures (arrays)
